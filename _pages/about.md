I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oslo, where I work with [Ingrid Lossius Falkum](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). In the summer of 2025, I will be starting a new post as assistant professor (biträdande universitetslektor) in linguistics at [Lund University](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), where I will be a part of the [Center for Languages and Literature](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

My research is anchored in the field of Experimental Pragmatics. I make use of psycholinguistic methods such as Eye-tracking, Mouse-tracking and reaction times measures to test and advance theories on how language is understood in context. I completed my PhD in 2021 at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, where I worked on the processing of novel, non-nominal metaphors under the supervision of [Pia Knoeferle](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). In my dissertation, I explored the ways in which leading theories of metaphor comprehension can account for language phenomena previously neglected, namely (contextualized) verbal and verb-object metaphors. Since then, I have mostly worked on how comprehenders think about the attitudes, beliefs and intentions of their interlocutors to make sense of the utterances they encounter. Together with [Ira Noveck](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), we have pursued this line by looking at the comprehension of irony and scalar implicatures. With [Filippo Domaneschi](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), we have looked at how understanding negative expressive adjectives (such as *damn* and *fucking*) is linked to knowledge of the speaker's attitudes and beliefs.  At the University of Oslo, we are working on understanding how absolute adjectives (like *full* and *straight*) are processed in context to generate precise and imprecise interpretations, as well as how their understanding develops with age. 

Under Publications you can find downloadable versions of my published articles, as well as the corresponding pre-registrations, data and analysis scripts. In my CV you can find some more info on my research output, my background and on the classes that I've taught and that I'm currently teaching.
