I am a post-doctoral researcher in the [Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Art and Ideas at the University of Oslo](https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/). In the summer of 2025, I will be starting a new post as Assistant Professor (*Biträdande Universitetslektor*) in Linguistics at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/home), where I will be a part of the [Center for Languages and Literature](https://www.sol.lu.se/en/). 

My research is anchored in the field of Experimental Pragmatics. I make use of psycholinguistic methods such as eye-tracking, mouse-tracking and reaction times measures to test and advance theories on how we use and understand language. I completed my PhD in 2021 at the [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/de), where I worked on metaphor comprehension under the supervision of [Pia Knoeferle](https://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~knoeferp/index.html). Since then, I have mostly worked on how comprehenders think about the attitudes, beliefs and intentions of their interlocutors to make sense of the language they use.  

I am particularly interested in studying how people understand figurative language (especially irony and metaphors), (scalar and manner) implicatures, (negative) expressive adjectives (such as *damn* and *fucking*) and (precise and imprecise) maximum standard absolute adjectives (such as *full* and *straight*). I also study how the ability to understand each of these phenomena develops with age.
