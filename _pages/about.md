I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oslo, where I work with [Ingrid Lossius Falkum](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). In the summer of 2025, I will be starting a new post as Assistant Professor (biträdande universitetslektor) in Linguistics at [Lund University](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), where I will be a part of the [Center for Languages and Literature](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

My research is anchored in the field of Experimental Pragmatics. I make use of psycholinguistic methods such as Eye-tracking, Mouse-tracking and reaction times measures to test and advance theories on how language is understood in context. I completed my PhD in 2021 at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, where I worked on the processing of novel, non-nominal metaphors under the supervision of [Pia Knoeferle](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). In my dissertation, I explored the ways in which leading theories of metaphor comprehension can account for language phenomena previously neglected, namely (contextualized) verbal and verb-object metaphors. Since then, I have mostly worked on how comprehenders think about the attitudes, beliefs and intentions of their interlocutors to make sense of the utterances they encounter. Together with [Ira Noveck](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), we have pursued this line by looking at the comprehension of irony and scalar implicatures. With [Filippo Domaneschi](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), we have looked at how understanding negative expressive adjectives (such as *damn* and *fucking*) is linked to knowledge of the speaker's attitudes and beliefs.  At the University of Oslo, we are working on understanding how absolute adjectives (like *full* and *straight*) are processed in context to generate precise and imprecise interpretations, as well as how their understanding develops with age.
