I am a post-doctoral researcher at [Department of Philosophy, Classics, History of Art and Ideas at the University of Oslo](https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/), where I work with [Ingrid Lossius Falkum](https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/people/aca/philosophy/tenured/ingridlf/). In the summer of 2025, I will be starting a new post as Assistant Professor (*Biträdande Universitetslektor*) in Linguistics at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/home), where I will be a part of the [Center for Languages and Literature](https://www.sol.lu.se/en/).

My research is anchored in the field of Experimental Pragmatics. I make use of psycholinguistic methods such as eye-tracking, mouse-tracking and reaction times measures to test and advance theories on how we use and understand language. I completed my PhD in 2021 at the [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/de), where I worked on the comprehension of novel, non-nominal metaphors under the supervision of [Pia Knoeferle](https://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~knoeferp/index.html). Since then, I have mostly worked on how comprehenders think about the attitudes, beliefs and intentions of their interlocutors to make sense of the utterances they encounter. Together with [Ira Noveck](https://sites.google.com/site/iranoveck/home), we have pursued this line by studying the comprehension of irony and scalar implicatures. With [Filippo Domaneschi](http://www.filippodomaneschi.com/), we have looked at how understanding negative expressive adjectives (such as *damn* and *fucking*) is linked to knowledge of the speaker's attitudes and beliefs. At the University of Oslo, I am currently studying how people are able to contextually adjust the meaning of adjectives on the fly (in particular, maximum standard absolute adjectives, like *full* and *straight*), as well as how this ability develops with age.
