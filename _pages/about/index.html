<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oslo, where I work with <a href="https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/english/people/aca/philosophy/tenured/ingridlf/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ingrid Lossius Falkum</a>. In the summer of 2025, I will be starting a new post as Assistant Professor (<em>Biträdande Universitetslektor</em>) in Linguistics at <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lund University</a>, where I will be a part of the <a href="https://www.sol.lu.se/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Center for Languages and Literature</a>.</p> <p>My research is anchored in the field of Experimental Pragmatics. I make use of psycholinguistic methods such as eye-tracking, mouse-tracking and reaction times measures to test and advance theories on how we use and understand language. I completed my PhD in 2021 at the <a href="https://www.hu-berlin.de/de" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin</a>, where I worked on the comprehension of novel, non-nominal metaphors under the supervision of <a href="https://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~knoeferp/index.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pia Knoeferle</a>. Since then, I have mostly worked on how comprehenders think about the attitudes, beliefs and intentions of their interlocutors to make sense of the utterances they encounter. Together with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/iranoveck/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ira Noveck</a>, we have pursued this line by studying the comprehension of irony and scalar implicatures. With <a href="http://www.filippodomaneschi.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Filippo Domaneschi</a>, we have looked at how understanding negative expressive adjectives (such as <em>damn</em> and <em>fucking</em>) is linked to knowledge of the speaker’s attitudes and beliefs. At the University of Oslo, I am currently studying how people are able to contextually adjust the meaning of adjectives on the fly, as well as how this ability develops with age.</p> <p>Under Publications you can find downloadable versions of my published articles, as well as the corresponding pre-registrations, data and analysis scripts.
