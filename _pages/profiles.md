Here is a picture of me with my most important collaborators, my cats Mar√≠a Remedios (bottom) and Dolores (top), or Meme and Lola for short.  

I am wearing my favorite socks, which were a present from [Austin Baker](https://www.austinabaker.com/).   
On the table there's a copy of [Orbital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_(novel)), which I really liked.
